# Lamini Program README

## Overview

This program demonstrates how to use the Lamini library to train and test a language model. It includes example code for setting up your API key, preparing training data, and generating responses using a pre-trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Lamini library (install using `pip install lamini`)

## Setup

1. **API Key Configuration**

   Replace the `api_key` placeholder with your Lamini API key:

   ```python
   try:
       lamini.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   except Exception as e:
       print("api error ::")
       raise e
   ````
